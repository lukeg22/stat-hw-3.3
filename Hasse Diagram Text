Our primary response to the SRQ is the sex of the fruit fly mates. Our factor is the mating condition of the fly. Our Hasse diagram represents our logical order of thinking to answer our SRQ. The first node represents the main action we need to study our SRQ and our grand mean. The second node act as a screen where we calculate the mean performance of each group in the experiment, then finding the difference between the two answers to account for grand mean performance. For the third node we take the mean of each student, then subtract the values of the corresponding observations from the previous 2 nodes.
