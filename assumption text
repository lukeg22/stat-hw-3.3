The qq-plot seems to satisfy the Gaussian assumption, as most of the points are distributed within the envelope of the plot.
The strip chart seems to satisfy the homoscedasticity condition, as there seems to be no significant difference in variation of the residuals, or any patterns in the chart.
The index plot seems to satisfy the independence of observations condition, as there is no discernible pattern of the residuals in the plot.
The Gaussian, homoscedasticity, and independence of observations assumptions all seem to be satisfied, so we can make the decision to use the parametric ANOVA F test for our confirmatory data analysis.
