The comparisons in condition that had a statistically significant difference were Null to Eight Virgin, One Pregnant to Eight Virgin, One Virgin to Eight Virgin, and Eight Pregnant to Eight Virgin. The mating condition of eight virgin fruit flies had a statistically significant difference to every other mating condition, while none of the other conditions were significantly different from one another. In addition, the p-values for each comparison including the eight virgin condition were all 0.000, much lower than our unusualness threshold of 0.03.
