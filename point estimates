The sample arithmetic mean of longevity is __ days per fly. Every condition, apart from the EightVirgin condition, has a larger mean lifespan per fly, ranging from __ more days per fly with the EightPreg condition to __ more days per fly with the OneVirgin condition. But, the mean lifespan per fly of those with the EightVirgin condition is __ days less than the sample arithmetic mean, and __ days less than the closest condition, which happens to be EightPreg.
